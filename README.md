# "Disease-economy trade-offs under alternative pandemic control strategies" replication package

This repository contains data, code, and images for the paper "Disease-economy trade-offs under alternative pandemic control strategies". The model output was generated in R 3.6.3.

This repository is still being cleaned up and made into a turnkey experience; your patience is appreciated!


### How is this repository organized?

	* /Code contains all of the R code used to generate model results.

	* /Data contains the contact matrices.

	* /Figures contains all of the figures used in the paper and code used to generate figures.

### What does the code in /bin do?

Broadly, there are three types of code files: R files which describe functions and algorithms (e.g., "functions.R"), R scripts which implement various algorithms and calculations (e.g., "epicon_script.R"), and shell scripts which call the R scripts (e.g., "generate_figure_2_data.sh").

#### Data inputs

#### Model outputs

### How do I recreate the figures and data files? (IN PROGRESS)

The first step is to make sure R and the necessary R packages are installed. You can find a list of necessary packages in the header of /Code/epicon_script.R. Installing R should take 5-10 minutes; you can install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

#### To generate the main model output, used in figures 2 and 3:

	* Run "generate_figure_2_data.sh". This will need to be the first thing you do. epicon_script.R is the main code which generates model output. Most other scripts either use this or its output.

	* Note that the number of cores is set to 80 by default; you will likely want to adjust this to match your computing equipment and time requirements. This code was run on a desktop computer running Ubuntu 20.04 with dual Intel Xeon Gold 6230 20C CPUs and 256 GB RAM, where it took roughly 5 hours. 
		- The memory requirement is relatively low, but the more cores the better. Each core requires an additional copy of the data, so will induce higher RAM use.

	* The header of the shell script describes the arguments to epicon_script.R.

#### To generate the model output used in figure 4 sensitivity analysis:

	* These were generated by running the Rscript calls in generate_figure_2_data.sh over a grid of values for the rho_c and rho_o arguments. The code was run on the BigRed3 system of the IU HPC cluster; detailed specifications can be found [here](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aoku).

	* Each point in the heatmap of the figures was generated using one node on the cluster. Each point took roughly 18-24 hours to compute.
